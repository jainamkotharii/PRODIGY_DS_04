# PRODIGY INFOTECH DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK 4

• Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

• Here's my submission for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I delved into social media data to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns, aiming to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis](twitter_training.csv) which is uploaded in this repository. This dataset contains Twitter messages, an associated entity, and the sentiment of the message about that entity (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

## Tools and Libraries used
1. Jupyter notebook
2. Pandas
3. TextBlob
4. Matplotlib

## Sentiment Analysis and Visualization
Here's how I conducted the sentiment analysis and visualization:

• Data Loading and Initial Exploration: Loaded the twitter_training.csv dataset and performed initial checks on its structure.

• Sentiment Extraction: Utilized the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on the text data, calculating polarity and subjectivity scores for each tweet. While the dataset already contains sentiment labels, TextBlob can be used for an independent sentiment score for further analysis or comparison.

• Sentiment Categorization: Categorized the sentiment into 'Positive', 'Negative', and 'Neutral' based on TextBlob's polarity scores, or directly used the provided sentiment labels from the dataset for analysis.

• Visualization of Sentiment Distribution: Generated various plots, such as bar charts and pie charts, to visualize the overall distribution of sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) across the dataset. This helps in understanding the general public opinion.

• Entity-Specific Sentiment Analysis (Optional but Recommended): Analyzed sentiment patterns related to specific entities or brands within the dataset to identify targeted public opinion.

## Conclusion

• To summarize, this task successfully demonstrated the analysis and visualization of sentiment patterns in social media data. By leveraging libraries like Pandas, TextBlob, and Matplotlib, valuable insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands were extracted and presented. This work provides a robust understanding of how sentiment analysis can be applied to large text datasets, laying the groundwork for more in-depth studies of public perception and brand reputation.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
